"""Layer 2 of validation: business rules that a JSON schema cannot express.

Each check returns a list of human-readable violations (empty list = OK).
A card is shown on the website only when Pydantic AND every rule here pass.

Note: these rules check format and banned content. They do NOT prove that a
claim is true — that is a separate, harder problem (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
